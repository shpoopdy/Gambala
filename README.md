# Gambala
An attempt at making a text (console) based casino game using C++.
As I take more classes I hope that this will only get better, 
structure wise and in overall enjoyment.

# How to use
If you clone this into your given directory you will see in the main.cpp file on the top 
there is a g++ line that you can use to run the first time. 
When you run this it will create a balance.txt file, tmp.txt file, 
and a user.txt file. It will ask for your name and then it will just 
show you your options for games. After that first time running it 
there will be the main.exe file in the same directory as the main.cpp 
which you will be able to click and run the program from there.
